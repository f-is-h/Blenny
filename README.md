# Blenny

Blenny is a minimal, native menu bar organizer designed exclusively for macOS 27 and later.

Project website: <https://blenny.fi5h.xyz>. The application uses the stable reverse-DNS bundle identifier `xyz.fi5h.blenny`.

The project is currently under private development. Versions `0.0.1` through `0.0.5` established the bounded macOS 27 backend, bundle-policy persistence, deterministic editing, rollback, and restoration foundations. Version `0.1.0` completed the first minimal AppKit product interface. Version `0.2.0` completed icon-first policy presentation: installed application icons from public AppKit/Workspace APIs, semantic SF Symbols for known read-only Apple system items, and one explicit fallback for unresolved candidates. Names, policies, bundle identifiers, observation counts, and read-only state remain available as supplementary text and accessibility information. Visible means Blenny does not conceal an item; macOS still owns final placement and native overflow. This remains a local engineering milestone, not a distributable release or a general compatibility claim.

Version `0.3.0` will establish the main product interface before new interaction features are added. It starts with a comparison of several distinct layout directions and an explicit owner choice, then implements the selected native AppKit hierarchy and visual system without drag-and-drop or policy/backend changes. Cross-lane draft dragging moves to `0.4.0`.

Blenny's application bundle uses the v12 color artwork from `Assets/AppIcon/`; the build deterministically derives the complete multi-resolution macOS icon resource from its 1024-pixel production PNG. The app icon remains separate from Blenny's status-item artwork: the status item uses a bundled, 18-point optical-size monochrome template SVG so AppKit can adapt it to the current menu-bar appearance without rescaling fine details, while the detailed status-item vector master remains under `Design/MenuBar/`. Blenny never captures live menu-bar pixels and does not require Screen Recording.

Existing local policy and recovery documents created with the former development identifier `com.example.BlennyProbe` migrate deterministically to `xyz.fi5h.blenny`. The migration preserves policy assignments and management state, updates both the accepted document and its scoped backup, is idempotent, and fails closed if both identities are already present.

## Product direction

- Use AppKit for status-item, window, and Accessibility infrastructure.
- Manage intent at the application-bundle level.
- Never move the pointer or synthesize Command-drag reordering.
- Avoid continuous polling and automatic reconciliation loops.
- Prefer native overflow presentation where it is adequate.
- Fail closed and restore deterministically when unsupported behavior changes.

Blenny is a clean implementation. It does not use or link Ice or Thaw code or binaries.

## Repository layout

- `Sources/` — product and bounded Debug-probe targets.
- `Tests/` — deterministic tests for identity, traversal, policy editing, the interface view model, transactions, overflow classification, and reversible state.
- `Assets/` — tracked application-icon sources and production menu-bar artwork copied or derived into the app bundle.
- `Research/` — historical, unsupported experiments excluded from product targets.
- `docs/` — roadmap, repository policy, API research, and technical-spike results.
- `LocalData/` — ignored local diagnostics, backups, binaries, screenshots, and build artifacts.

## Build

Blenny requires Xcode 27 and the macOS 27 SDK.

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcrun swift test

DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer \
  ./scripts/build-app.sh debug
```

The `Research/` probes are not built by the Swift package and are not supported product entry points.

## Unsupported system behavior

The validated architecture includes version-sensitive, unsupported macOS behavior. Public APIs alone do not provide the required bundle-level presentation control. The production backend must remain isolated, build-gated, reversible, and protected by an emergency compatibility kill switch.

Do not treat the historical research probes as safe general-purpose utilities.

## License

No open-source license has been selected yet. A license will be added before the first public release. Until then, this repository is not offered for redistribution.
